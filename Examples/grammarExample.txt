# This is a simple grammar definition example.
# 
# Each row describes a grammar rule, in the form:
# {SYMBOL}:<EXPRESSION>
#
# or:
# {SYMBOL}:<EXPRESSION1>|<EXPRESSION2>|<EXPRESSION3>
# where <EXPRESSION1>, <EXPRESSION2>, <EXPRESSION3> represents transformations for {SYMBOL}; it's a compact form equivalent to:
# {SYMBOL}:<EXPRESSION1>
# {SYMBOL}:<EXPRESSION2>
# {SYMBOL}:<EXPRESSION3>
#
# On this file:
# 1."{SUBJECT}", "{ANIMAL}" and "{PERSON}" are grammar symbols (surrounded by curly brackets).
# 2. "a dog", "a cat", "John" and "{PERSON}'s dog" are expressions; an expression can be:
# - a symbol e.g. {ANIMAL}"
# - a constant e.g. "a cat"
# - a constant with symbols e.g. "{PERSON}'s dog"
#
# You can use some special characters in expressions:
# - "{{" and "}}" represents the characters "{" and "}"
# - "||" represents the vertical bar character
# - "\n" represents a newline character
#
# Lines starting with "#" and empty lines are ignored.
#
# The symbol at the left of the first rule is considered the starting symbol ({SUBJECT} in the example below).
#
# See the test project for library usage.
#
{SUBJECT}:{ANIMAL}
{SUBJECT}:{PERSON}
{ANIMAL}:a dog|a cat
{ANIMAL}:{PERSON}'s dog
{PERSON}:John
#
# Generated final sentences, starting from {SUBJECT} are:
#
# "a dog", generated by {SUBJECT} -> {ANIMAL} -> "a dog"
# "a cat", generated by {SUBJECT} -> {ANIMAL} -> "a cat"
# "John", generated by {SUBJECT} -> {PERSON} -> "John"
# "John's dog", generated by {SUBJECT} -> "{PERSON}'s dog" -> "John's dog"

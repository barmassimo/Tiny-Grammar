# This is a simple grammar definition example.
# 
# Each row describes a grammar rule.
#
# SUBJECT, ANIMAL and PERSON are grammar symbols (surrounded by curly brackets).
# "a dog", "a cat" and "John" are constant, terminal symbols.
#
# Lines starting with "#" are comments and are ignored.
#
# The symbol at the left of the first rule is considered the starting symbol (SUBJECT in the example below).
#
# See the test project for some examples of grammar definition files and library usage.
#
{SUBJECT}:{ANIMAL}
{SUBJECT}:{PERSON}
{ANIMAL}:a dog
{ANIMAL}:a cat
{PERSON}:John

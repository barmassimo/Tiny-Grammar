TinyGrammar
===========

TinyGrammar is a minimalistic implementation of Chomsky's [generative grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_grammar).

The generator creates random sentences starting from a grammar definition; it can be used as a library or via command line.

Grammar rules can be added programmaticaly or stored on a text file in a very intuitive format - [here's an example](Examples/grammarExample.txt).

## Live examples

I used TinyGrammar for two generators, you can try them on my site:

* [Tecnichese generator](http://massimobarbieri.it/it/Tecnichese) is a funny nonsense-technical Italian sentence generator

* [Sonic Pi nonsense music generator](http://massimobarbieri.it/en/SonicPiGenerator) is a generator of code for [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net), the "Live Coding Music Synth" created by Sam Aaron.

Both grammar definitions are included in the Examples folder.

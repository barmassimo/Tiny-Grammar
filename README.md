TinyGrammar
===========

A minimalistic implementation of Chomsky's [generative grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_grammar)

The generator can be used as a library (no external dependencies) or via command line.

Grammar rules can be added programmaticaly or stored on a text file in a very intuitive format (here's an example)  [an example](examples/grammarExample.txt)

## Live example

See [my site](http://massimobarbieri.it/it/Tecnichese) for a funny nonsense-tecnical Italian sentence generator

I'm working also on a generator for [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net) (a very incomplete example is included)
